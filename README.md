# 🍪 A up-to-date Cookiecutter template for MLOps

Inspired by the original [cookiecutter-data-science](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/v1/) template and [Nicky Skafte's mlops_template](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/mlops_template).
This setup is made very specific to the needs of myself and data scientists with a lot of CI/CD work and time spent making packages. Where possible, the tooling from the [MLOps course](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/dtu_mlops) is used.

## ✋ Requirements to use the template:

* Python 3.11 or higher
* [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) version 2.4.0 or higher

## 🆕 Start a new project

Start by creating a repository either using the GitHub GUI in the web browser or alternatively you can use the
[GitHub command line interface](https://cli.github.com/) if you have set it up:

```bash
gh repo create <repo_name> --public --confirm
```
Afterwards on your local machine run

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/AndersHenriksen-dev/python_mlops_cookiecutter_template
```

You will be prompted with the following questions:

```txt
    [1/8] repo_name (repo_name):
    [2/8] project_name (project_name):
    [3/8] Select deps_manager
        1 - uv
        2 - pip
        Choose from [1/2] (1):
    [4/8] Select use_logging
        1 - y
        2 - n
        Choose from [1/2] (1):
    [5/8] author_name (Your name (or your organization/company/team)):
    [6/8] description (A short description of the project.):
    [7/8] python_version (3.12):
    [8/8] Select open_source_license
        1 - No license file
        2 - MIT
        3 - BSD-3-Clause
        Choose from [1/2/3] (1):
```

Where you should input starting values for the project. A couple of notes regarding the different options:

1. When asked for the `repo_name` e.g. the repository name, this should be the same as when you created the Github
    repository in the beginning.

2. When asked for the `project_name` this should be a
    [valid Python package name](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names). This means that the name
    should be all lowercase and only contain letters, numbers and underscores. The project name will be used as the name
    of the Python package. This will automatically be validated by the template.

3. The `author_name` and `description` fields are purely meant for the readme and other text fields. Besides this, they make no functional difference.

To commit to the remote repository afterwards execute the following series of commands:

```bash
cd <repo_name>
git init
git add .
git commit -m "init cookiecutter project"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo_name>
git push origin master
```

## 🗃️ Repository structure

Assuming you choose the `advance` structure, the repository will look like
something like this:
